# emergency-alert
To create emergency alert for various scenarios using ML and send to relevant authorities to take action against it. 

# My idea  
 	The Idea is to create an emergency 
   1.	When user explicitly needs to create emergency 
   2.	Automatic emergency when user encounters an accident 
   
   And using this emergency alert we can take required actions against it
 	
# Plan on bringing it to life. 

 This will be a feature in all android devices to have Emergency alert functionality using ML. Following are the scenarios when it will be used
 
1.	When user explicitly needs to create emergency 

   a.	Situation: 
      i.	It happens user sees a situation (roberry,kidnapping,street fights,public voilence etc) when any android user can use this feature          to capture majority of the evidence needed for future investigation purpose
      
     ii.	It happens when user itself stuck in these (roberry,kidnapping,street fights,public voilence etc)  situations.
     
    iii.	It happens when a user using the safe driving mode feature and met with an accident.
    
   b.	Usefulness: 
      i.	Further it will be useful for face recognition, place recognition and can be used for vehicle recognition
      
     ii.	If user itself stuck in this situation user can generate Alerts with google assistant. And as soon as alert is created the device          will be in a lock mode with flash opened and taking pictures with a regular time interval for future evidence. Which further can            be useful for getting visual information for that incident for example in case of kidnapping we can get visual evidence for                vehicle model inside/outside (using ML) and will inform local police department, which further will decrease the probability of            committing a crime
     
     iii.	If user met with an accident while driving based on sensors and ML, we will be able to know that user is in emergency and will generate emergency. Which further will inform the nearest EMS.

# About myslef. 

  Currently I am working as an Android Software Engineer with Tyler public safety on a contractual basis. Sheildforce and cerwforce are   the apps which I am currently working. As above idea is just in the idea phase I am having no prototype for it. But would love to be a   part of innovation for this feature.
